## About the Collection

The ArtGutz Black Walnut Collection is an exhibit of found-object art featuring black walnuts.

This exhibit is excerpted from the larger, personal Gary L. Carlson art and writing collection that documents 
the creative and intellectual activities of my late grandfather, Gary L. Carlson (1947-2013). The full collection 
consists of his digitized art and writing, including short stories, journal entries, personal notes, essays, 
and found-object art. While he definitively created the art between 1999 and 2012, the timeframes for his 
writings are more ambiguous. They range approximately from the late 1960s/early 1970s through the early 1990s, 
in Portland, Oregon, where he attended college; Upstate New York (Geneva, Penn Yan, and Romulus), where he lived 
for most of his adult life; and possibly Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he was born and raised. He curated 
and displayed most of his art in the secretive Side Show Metropolitan Museum, his makeshift gallery and studio 
located in the cellar of the dive bar, Side Show, which he co-owned and operated with my grandmother, Anita K.
Carlson (1945-2019), for more than three decades.

## About the Artist

From the creator's self-authored obituary: 

"Gary L. Carlson was born June 28, 1947 to Pat and Fay Carlson in Minneapolis Minnesota. He attended 
Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis and Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. An army veteran, 
he attained the storied rank of E-4 during his military service. Know to many as 'Pa', which he didn't like, 
he tended bar for 27 years at the Side Show, making many cherished friends over the years. He was the 
creator and curator of the Side Show Metropolitan Museum and had great fun taking people on tours of the 
studio art there. In his spare time he avoided playing euchre, golf and bowling. He died at the age of 66 
on October 9, 2013 at home after a not particularly courageous battle with rheumatoid arthritis and lung cancer."
